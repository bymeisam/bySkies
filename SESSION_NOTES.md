# BySkies Development Session Notes

## Current Status (v1.0.3)

### Last Session Summary
We were debugging issues where API calls were working but cards were showing empty or "Coming soon" instead of real data.

### Issues Fixed in This Session
1. ‚úÖ **Missing Forecast Hook** - Added `useForecast()` call in weather dashboard
2. ‚úÖ **Missing Activity Suggestions Hook** - Added `useActivitySuggestions()` call  
3. ‚úÖ **Loading State Management** - Fixed all hooks with proper `finally` blocks
4. ‚úÖ **Added Comprehensive Logging** - All API calls and state changes now logged
5. ‚úÖ **Version Tracking System** - Added v1.0.3 indicator in bottom-right corner

### Console Logging Added
- üå§Ô∏è `getCurrentWeather` API calls and responses
- üìä `getForecast` API calls and responses  
- üå¨Ô∏è `getAirPollution` API calls and responses
- üìç `getLocationName` API calls and responses
- üîç `searchLocations` API calls and responses
- üîß Store State Debug logs showing all data flow

### Expected Behavior
When clicking "Get Started":
1. Should see 4 API calls in console: getLocationName, getCurrentWeather, getForecast, getAirPollution
2. All API calls should return successful responses
3. Weather card should show real weather data (not empty)
4. Activity suggestions card should show real suggestions (not "Coming soon")
5. Version indicator should show v1.0.3 in bottom-right corner

### Current Problems to Investigate Tomorrow
- API calls are working and returning data
- But cards are still showing empty/loading states
- Need to check if data is properly flowing from API responses to UI components
- Debug logs will show exactly what's in the store state

### Development Server
```bash
cd /home/meisam/Projects/bySkies && yarn dev --port 3001
```

### Files Modified in Last Session
1. `/home/meisam/Projects/bySkies/apps/web/lib/weather/api.ts` - Added console logging to all API functions
2. `/home/meisam/Projects/bySkies/apps/web/lib/hooks/use-weather.ts` - Fixed loading states with finally blocks
3. `/home/meisam/Projects/bySkies/apps/web/components/weather/weather-dashboard.tsx` - Added missing hooks and debug logging

### Next Steps for Tomorrow
1. Check if version shows v1.0.3 (confirms no caching issues)
2. Open browser console and click "Get Started"
3. Verify all 4 API calls are logged and successful
4. Check üîß Store State Debug logs to see if data reaches the store
5. If data is in store but not showing in UI, investigate component rendering logic

### Key Debugging Questions for Tomorrow
- Do the üîß Store State Debug logs show `currentWeather`, `airQuality`, and `suggestions` populated?
- Is `hasAllData()` returning true when data is loaded?
- Is `canShowSuggestions()` returning true when suggestions are ready?
- Are the cards still showing loading states even when `isAnyLoading()` returns false?

### Architecture Notes
- Using Zustand for state management
- React Query (TanStack Query) for API caching
- OpenWeatherMap API with hardcoded key: "55cd1a140017e2635e0fdbc9b920ae24"
- Turborepo monorepo structure with packages/ui for components
- Version tracking system for cache-busting during development
